# Quran Metadata Format

This format is to annotate Quran texts with some metadata. If follows the
[N3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notation3) format (a plaintext format)
and the [Dublin Core](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_Core)
[Metadata Element Set](http://dublincore.org/documents/dces) vocabulary.
Both of these technologies are [w3c](http://w3c.org) standards.

The extension for a Quran Metadata Format file is `.qmf`, and it is
usually shipped alongside the file(s) that it describes.


## Example

A typical `qmf` file looks like this:

    @prefix : <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/>.
    <>
    :title      "De Edele Koran";
    :creator    "Sofian S. Siregar";
    :publisher  "ICCN";
    :date       "2000";
    :language   "nl";
    :format     "qtf";
    :type       "translation";
    :identifier "URN:ISBN:90-73355-08-7".

The first line includes the Dublin Core Elements vocabulary.
The second line starts an unnamed resource (the file it describes)
the conscutive lines describe properties and their values on the
unnamed resource.
